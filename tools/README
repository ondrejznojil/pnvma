Right now this contain only genplatform utility for making
platform header file out of net template specification written in PNAL.
It's a c++ application with the same requirements as pnvmx86:

  * boost.program_options
  * log4cxx

Usage:
  ./getplatform -i platform.txt -o ../includes/pnvm_platform.h
